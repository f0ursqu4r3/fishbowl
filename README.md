# fishbowl

Fishbowl is a tiny game about a person living in their apartment. The player is not directly controlling the character, but instead is watching them from a top-down perspective. The player can interact with the character by clicking on objects in the apartment, which will trigger different actions. The character will also interact with the player by talking to them, asking for help, or reacting to the player's actions.
